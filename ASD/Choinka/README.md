# What is this?

This is the repository of my project for the [Algorithms and Data Structures (pol. Algorytmy i Struktury Danych, ASD)](https://usosweb.mimuw.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&prz_kod=1000-213bASD&callback=g_1117861b) course offered by the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics at the University of Warsaw (further referred to as "MIM UW") in the 2022/2023 winter semester.

# Brief description
The task was to write efficient algorithm for checking and updating nodes in tree data structure (managing ornament colors on a large Christmas tree).

The algorithm combines Depth-First Search (DFS) and segment tree data structures for managing ornament colors on a Christmas tree. DFS is used to structure the tree in the segment tree array, which facilitates fast color updates and checks. The segment tree efficiently merges subtree color information and verifies if a subtree meets the color criteria. This method allows for rapid processing of color-related queries on the tree.
