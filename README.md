# University Coursework Archive

This repository serves as an archive for most of my projects completed during my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the [Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics, and Mechanics of the University of Warsaw](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/). The repository is organized into folders named after the acronyms of the courses in Polish. Below are the courses and their brief descriptions:

## AKSO (eng. Computer Architecture and Operating Systems, pol. Architektura komputerów i systemy operacyjne)
This course covers the structure and functioning principles of contemporary computers, low-level programming, application binary interface, the role and tasks of the operating system, and techniques for managing basic hardware resources of the computer: processor, operating memory, and input-output devices.

## BD (eng. Databases, pol. Bazy Danych)
The course focuses on the functions and structures of database systems and an overview of data models. It includes relational databases, query languages for relational databases (relational algebra, first-order logic, SQL), database design (conceptual modeling and transitioning to the logical level), physical aspects of data storage and query execution, and query optimization methods.

## WPI (eng. Introductory Programming, pol. Wstęp do programowania)
This foundational course introduces students to the field of computer science, familiarizing them with the concepts of algorithms and programming. It teaches the design, notation, verification of correctness, and consideration of the complexity of algorithms. The course presents programming techniques and data structures used in small and medium-scale programming.

## ASD (eng. Algorithms and Data Structures, pol. Algorytmy i Struktury Danych)
This course involves the design and analysis of algorithms. It provides an overview of basic algorithms and data structures, enhancing practical skills in designing and programming correct and efficient algorithms, and using existing libraries of algorithms and data structures.

## PO (eng. Object-Oriented Programming, pol. Programowanie Obiektowe)
The course covers basic concepts and issues in object-oriented programming: classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and the fundamentals of object-oriented design, along with formalisms for documenting and writing object-oriented projects and programs.

Each course has contributed significantly to my academic and professional development in the field of computer science.
